This is sample of mixed precision arithmetic from C#. 

GPU support mixed precision starting from computing capability 5.3, which means Volta, Pascal, and Jetson TX1

Before that (Maxwell, Kepler, Fermi...), the generated code won't compile. Therefore, the project is not built as part of the solution.
